# Bayesian-Neural-Network


A Bayesian neural network is a type of neural network that is trained using Bayesian inference. This means that instead of just learning the weights and biases of the network based on a training dataset, the network also learns a distribution over those weights and biases.

In a traditional neural network, the weights and biases are typically chosen to minimize the error between the predicted output of the network and the true output on the training dataset. This is done using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent.

However, in a Bayesian neural network, the weights and biases are treated as random variables, and a probability distribution is learned over them. This distribution reflects the uncertainty of the network about the optimal weights and biases for the given task.

One advantage of using a Bayesian neural network is that it can provide uncertainty estimates for its predictions. This can be useful in applications where the uncertainty of the prediction is important, such as in medical diagnosis or self-driving cars.

Overall, Bayesian neural networks offer a different approach to training neural networks that can be useful in certain situations where traditional neural networks may not be ideal.
